        <h2>What is Cervical Cancer?</h2>
        <p>Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that occurs in the cells of the cervix â€“ the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina.  It's often caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), a common sexually transmitted infection.</p>

    <section id="screening">
        <h2>The Importance of Screening (Smear Tests)</h2>
        <p>Regular cervical screening (also known as a smear test) can detect abnormal cell changes in the cervix, allowing for early treatment and preventing cancer from developing.  It's a quick and simple procedure that can save your life.</p>
        <p>In the UK, women aged 25-49 are invited for screening every 3 years, and women aged 50-64 every 5 years.  If you're eligible, please attend your appointment.</p>

        <h2>Symptoms to Be Aware Of</h2>
        <p>In the early stages, cervical cancer often has no symptoms.  However, as it progresses, you may experience:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unusual vaginal bleeding, such as bleeding between periods, after sex, or after menopause</li>
            <li>Changes to your vaginal discharge</li>
            <li>Pain during sex</li>
            <li>Pelvic pain</li>
            </ul>
        <p>If you experience any of these symptoms, it's important to see your GP as soon as possible.</p>
